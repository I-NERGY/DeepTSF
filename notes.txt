1. Try a pure autoregressive model (without external variables), so as to directly compare to SARIMA.

2. Train an MLP that also has as input values of same hour of previous day, week, month, year. 
   This will transfer the ARIMA concept in neural networks and can be compared to an lstm.

3. Also add other time series as features

4. Transfer experiments in gluon (gluonts_incomplete.ipynb) and mlflow.

5. ASK MATRYCS (Δημητρόπουλος) for multi steps forecasts

6. ASK dimitropoulos specifically for VEOLIA data. They have already used them.
