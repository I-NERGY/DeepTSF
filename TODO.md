# Tasks
## VEOLIA - UC4 
1. Create a unified dataset as a multidimensional timeseries.
2. Add extra time features like year, month, day, day of week. (see ev-charging).
3. Handle missing values.
4. Proceed to an exploratory analysis and decide features (most of the variables) / targets (DEMANDAs).
5. Decide granularity. (15 min?)
6. Apply ML models.

## ZEZ
1. Try to undestand the data. What different measurements do the 2 different excel files contain?
2. Maybe Seek for weather conditions in the area of the specific building as they are not provided in the dataset.
3. Exploratory? Only one month of data. Maybe not useful to start developing models.
4. Maybe write code for the online data ingestion procedure? Or wait?

## FAEN - UC14
EPC oriented not related with demand forecasts
1. Parse EPC XMLs and decide if we need something from these data.

## FAEN - UC15
